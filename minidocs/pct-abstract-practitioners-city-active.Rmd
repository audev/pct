## Abstract

The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) was proposed in late 2014 by the Department for Transport (DfT) to enable better prioritisation of funding for cycling in England and beyond. This involved analysis of current cycling behaviour, scenario-based models, and the creation of an on-line interactive tool. A year and a half later and the Propensity to Cycle tool is ready for nationwide deployment. It aims to provide an evidence base for transport planners, researchers and the public to help understand where cycling has the greatest potential to grow. This paper traces the development of the PCT from its inception through to user testing and its possible futures for its future development. The focus is on how new open source tools can empower transport decision makers to plan for a low carbon future.
