Plan with RG:

Phase 1: Use a spatial interaction model (the radiation model) to estimate flows.

Primarily useful for inter-settlement flows.

Phase 2: Estimate the emission and allocate them to the route network

Datasets:

- Data on population of settlements
- Modal/distance split of commutes
- Allocating trips by mode
- Use the Google API to get route-allocated times
- Output from Google API

Visualisation:

- We'll make an interactive map of the results

Software

- An interface to the Google travel times API
- R coding: primarily
